# Advent of Code 2023

Using Rust again for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)!

Run the challenge with:

```
$ cargo run --bin day<length-2-zero-padded-day>-part<1-or-2>
```

For example, day 1 part 2 would be:

```
$ cargo run --bin day01-part2
```

And day 20 part 1 would be:

```
$ cargo run --bin day20-part1
```

My input data is stored as text files in the `data/` directory.
